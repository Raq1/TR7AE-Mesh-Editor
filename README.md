In comparision to the Noesis plugin I previously made 3 years ago, this Blender addon is full of brand new features, available thanks to a deeper understanding of the format and
thanks to

- Properly read HInfo such as HBox, HSphere, HMarkers and HCapsules
- Tweak HInfo such as position, rotation and scale (where applicable) and export it
- Vertex color import/export
-
