In comparision to the Noesis plugin I previously made 3 years ago, this Blender addon is full of brand new features, available thanks to a deeper understanding of the format and thanks to Blender's API which allows to import much more metadata than Noesis allows.

Features include:

- HInfo import/export such as HBox, HSphere, HMarkers and HCapsules
- HInfo live editing such as position, rotation and scale (where applicable) and export
- Vertex color import/export
- Environment Mapping import/export, to create meshes with reflection
- Filesize of exported models is now significantly reduced thanks to a more optimized way of storing weights

(Example of vertex colors import and export)
